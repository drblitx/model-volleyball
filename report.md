# Personal Volleyball Statistics: An Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This is a personal data science project analyzing my performance across three high school volleyball seasons: freshman (2016), sophomore (2017), and senior (2019). The junior season (2018) is omitted from the match-level statistics due to incomplete record-keeping, although match schedules and results are available. In addition to the analyses of the three seasons, I wanted to address the junior season gap for match-by-match and relative estimated season-long statistics using a combination of previous performance trends and developmental trajectory (using senior year statistics).

My motivation for this project is to clarify discrepancies in the official statistics, particularly for kills and digs. In one instance during junior year, a well-executed attack was initially not recorded as a kill because the ball "touched an opponent" before hitting the floor. According to official volleyball rules, a kill is defined as any attack attempt that is unreturnable by the opponent and results directly in a point, regardless of whether the ball touches a player before landing. This realization prompted a deeper investigation into the legitimacy of my junior year statistics.

Regardless of the fact that this occured over five years ago, by compiling and cleaning match-level data from each available season, this project will create a comprehensive dataset that supports analysis of performance trends, match outcomes, and developmental progress. The focus is on understanding how I performed in the seasons, and filling gaps in my junior year record.
